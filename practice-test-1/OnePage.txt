 HERMIA
  [Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best 

To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast! 

Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here! 

Lysander, look how I do quake with fear: 

Methought a serpent eat my heart away, 

And you sat smiling at his cruel pray. 
Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord! 
What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word? 

Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear; 

Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear. 

No? then I well perceive you all not nigh 

Either death or you I'll find immediately.
