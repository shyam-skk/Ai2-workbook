## NLP Projects

### 1. Text, file and pdf manipulation using python
### 2. Text formatting using NLP - python
### 3. Quora Question Classification using NLP - Neural Network
Deep Learning, Text-Mining, Natural Language Processing . 
Used Spacy and NLTK for text data pre-processing (Count Vectorizing, Tokenizing, Stemming & Lemmatization ).
Performed topic modelling and topic labelling using LDA and NMF deep learning libraries.
Used gridSearch to find out the best LDA model with optimized parameter values ( n components, learning decay, learning offset, and max-iter)
Implemented supervised learning on the best-labeled LDA model output dataset (Log-Likelihood Score:
-2823614.416, Model Perplexity: 3469.486). 
LinearSVC model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.856.
### 4. Ham and Spam Classification
